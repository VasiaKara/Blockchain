# Blockchain

This repository consists of 4 practical exercises in blockchain. Those exercises are part of Blockchain course(Spring 2021) that
focusing both on basic cryptocurrency principles and their practical implementation. 

A small guide for those labs is presented below:

Lab 1:  Ethereum private network
In this lab we create a private ethereum network locally and we test basic commands and actions in the network

Lab 2:	Develop and Deploy a Smart Contract
In this lab we develop a smart contract handling basic operations of an auction like bid and withdraw. We perform several checks to assure that only auction creator 
can withdraw the ammount of highest bid. Furthermore there is a convention that candidate bidders are not able to bid with offers smaller than the highest bid. 
However based on the exercise there are also some restrictions (i.e highest bidder is not capable of withdrawal).

Lab 3 - 4: Deploy smart contract to a private network/Deploy smart contract to a public network.  

Lab 5: Perform several checks using  unit test to ascertain exercise restrictions.

Lab 6: Finally we develop a distributed app to handle basic operations of this contract through an ui and submit it in:  https://dimitrapanagiotou.github.io/AuctionApplication/
